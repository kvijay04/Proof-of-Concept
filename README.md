# Proof of Concept

### This program uses scikit-learn version 1.5.2 and kivy version 0.7.0

## Code was written and compiled using VSCode version 1.94.0 and the operating system the program was compiled on is Windows 11 Home Version 23H2
### Because of python's universal nature, this program should compile on any major operating system, as long as the required dependencies are installed


## scikit-learn  and kivy must be installed on your device in order for this program to run. They can be installed by running the following in a terminal:
### pip install -U scikit-learn
### pip install Kivy



# Running Program:

## In order to run the program, download the files backend.py and frontend.py into a folder, navigate to that folder in a terminal, and run the following command:

### python ./frontend.py

## This will open a window through kivy, and output a result array derived from a scikit-learn function in the window. This demonstrates that the two major dependencies, scikit-learn and kivy, are able to work together in a single program

## Additionally, if one wishes to test only the backend, then run the following command, which will output to the console the same array seen in the kivy window generated by frontend.py:

### python ./backend.py
